** Discourse referents and dynamic notions of content

- [cite:@Heim1982]
  Foundational work developing /file-change semantics/ (see chapter 3). Proposes that the meaning of a sentence in natural language is a function from files to files; proposes a concomitant enrichment of Stalnakerian contexts.
- [cite:@GroenendijkStokhof1991]
  Develops a semantics for a first-order calculus which gets to the heart of dynamic treatments of anaphora; the extension of a formula is a /relation between assignments/, as opposed to a set of assignments.
- [cite:@Dekker1994]
  Develops a logic with a syntactic distinction between variables and pronouns.
- [cite:@RothschildYalcin2016]
  Investigation of logical properties of dynamic theories, and what counts as a truly /dynamic/ semantics.
